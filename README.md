# Currency-Converter           Description
🧠 Introduction

The Currency Converter is a simple web application that allows users to quickly convert one currency into another — for example, converting US Dollars (USD) to Indian Rupees (INR) or Euros (EUR).
It helps people know how much their money is worth in a different country’s currency.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — three core web technologies that every student learning web development should know.

🧩 How It Works

    The user enters an amount of money (for example, “100”).
    
    The user selects the From Currency (e.g., USD) and the To Currency (e.g., INR).
    
    When the user clicks the Convert button, the JavaScript code calculates the converted amount.
    
    The converted value is shown on the screen instantly.
    
    The conversion is done using either:
    
    Fixed exchange rates defined in the code, or
    
    A live currency API (like ExchangeRate-API) to get real-time conversion rates.

🧱 Technologies Used

  > HTML (HyperText Markup Language) → Builds the structure of the webpage (input boxes, buttons, dropdowns, etc.)
  
  > CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) → Adds design, colors, spacing, and makes the app look neat and attractive
  
  > JavaScript → Handles all the logic, calculations, and updates the result dynamically when the user interacts with the page

✨ Main Features

✅ Easy to use interface
✅ Instant currency conversion
✅ Works with multiple currencies
✅ Responsive design (works on phone and computer)
✅ Option to connect with real-time exchange rate API

🎯 Learning Outcomes

By making this project, students will:

  Understand how to create and design a web page using HTML and CSS
  
  Learn how to write JavaScript functions to perform calculations
  
  Practice how to get user input and display output dynamically
  
  Learn how to use APIs to get live data from the internet
  
  Build confidence in creating small interactive web applications

💬 Example

If you enter 100 USD and choose to convert it to INR, the program will show something like:

💵 100 USD = ₹8,300 INR (based on the current exchange rat
